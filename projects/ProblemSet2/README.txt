This folder contains code for the second problem set of APMA 4301. The file problem2a.py creates convergence plots for the first and second derivatives of x^2+sin(4pi*x) using a 3 point stencil and problem2b.py does the same but with a 5 point stencil. problem3b.py is a modified version of poisson1d_mms.py which solves a 1d Poisson problem and plots the convergence of 2 types of error. The subfolder Latex contains the pdf of the problem set and the tex source and included pdf images.
